## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
No, none

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
Many times I had an issue with Javascript's error processing. I got stuck a few times simpily due to a small typo that Javascript compiled anyways, which resulted in complex and untimely bug hunts only to discover all I had was a small typo. Utilizng the console log helped narrow issues down tremendously, and modularizing all my code also helped me conceptualize the issues better. Additionally, it was also oftentimes difficult to see what object type a variable was, and how flexible object comparisons were.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I thought of a number of questions while working on this assignment. How common is using Glitch? Do most developers use it to help develop their own code? Additionally, for a while, I tried to get the browser to work on my own local host. What is the most efficient or common ways people make static web browsers? Are there any other common languages other than javascript for static web browsers? How do old versions of Javascript browsers communicate with each other? 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I'd like to try something with formatting, specifically trying out adding different photos, victory screens, or buttons styles to make the game a bit more interactive. Specifically, I was imagining if you could only see a certain radius around your mouse and everything else was darkened out, forcing the player to be extra tentative. I'd also like to try scrambling the buttons each game in order to add a bit more replayablility.
